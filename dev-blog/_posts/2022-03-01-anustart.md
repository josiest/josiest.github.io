title: So I'm starting a blog...
---
# A blog? That's so 2005
Maybe. But it's something that I've been thinking about doing for a while now.
I've always though blogs like Amit Patel's
[Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/) were super cool. I've also
really enjoyed Sebastian Lague's
[Coding Adventures](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague/featured).
I have a lot of small projects that I work on from time-to-time that I think
have potential to be at least somewhat as cool as what these guys do. So I'm
starting a blog to talk about them and make status updates about the progress I
make with them.

I'm not much of a videographer, so I probably won't do a video blog - at least
not any time soon. But I thought doing a web-blog is definitely something that
I can pull off. I already have a bunch of projects that are either on the
backburner or that I'm currently working on when I procrastinate on schoolwork,
so I'm thinking it won't be long before there's some interesting content here.

# plans for the future
I want to eventually have an index of projects I'm working on where you can find
all my posts related to that project. Or maybe all the posts also have tags about
the kind of content I talk about (graph algorithms for example), so that you can
search for them easily.

I also plan on self-teaching myself some graduate-level mathematics, so I might
even start another blog where I talk about the stuff I'm learning from that and
how I'm processing those things. Maybe I'll even post some proofs there.
